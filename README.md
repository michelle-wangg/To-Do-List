# Life Organizer Application
## A to-do list to meet your everyday needs

*"For every **minute** spend in organizing, an **hour** is earned"*

-*Benjamin Franklin*

This application will be the ultimate to-do list to meet the users' everyday needs whether the user is a working adult, 
student in university, or an entrepreneur running their own business. The minimalistic design of this application will
allow the user to focus on the important things in life while still
offering all the components that are essential to a productive day. These include the simple ability to add/delete
tasks, and mark them as complete/incomplete.
In essence, this application will help de-clutter
the mind and allow for users to reach their goals.

This project is of interest to me because I often find myself in a state of chaos whenever I have to think about all
the things I have to do for the day. I have multiple different applications running to organize my thoughts, and 
I always end up more disorganized and overwhelmed than before. The goal of this application is to provide
the ultimate to-do list so that all tasks can be organized in one location.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to add a task to my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to view the tasks on my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a task off my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a task as complete on my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a task as incomplete on my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to save my to-do list to file

## Phase 4: Task 3
Some refactoring to improve the design of this application:
- I would refactor my code to make it more robust, so it can throw exceptions if an error were to occur. 
This will be beneficial if the user somehow inputs data that is not valid and still be able to recover from it.
- There is some redundancy in my code, especially in my GUI class that can be refactored to make the code easier to 
change in the future in case there are bugs or if I want to add additional functionality.
- I may also want to move some method and classes around in my GUI class as it is a pretty long public class that can
be split up to make it easier to work with.
